### Reflect on how encaspulation and generaliztion helped break down the drawing proces for this secne.###
When reflecting on what the terms encapsulation adn gerealiztion, It makes me underrstand some of the perviou topics that I sturggled with. 
# Exmaple: #def square(lenght): #Parameters are used to make the code more general.
#               for i in range(4):
#                   forward(length)
#                   left(90)
This for loop uses both encapsulation and generaliztion. In the header of the code, the parameters are length. By including lenght in the header and the body, when the function is called, you can define what you want the length to be.

### How it helped with the lab. 
I have had some trouble with how to do some small parts of the lab. 
The specific issue is trying to use what I know about encapsulation and generalization to fix the stem and the mouth of the Jack-o_Lanterns.
I have tried to use the AI assistance to help me find out a solution. 
I got as far as understanding that the function that is used to create the stem is encaspulated within the definied function for the pumpkin.
I used the AI assistant to help me refactor the code and to move both the mouth and the stem into the proper place.
# What i changed:
## Exmaple:  # Drawing the stem
                t.penup()       # Moves turtle up with no marks on canvas
                t.goto(x, y + radius)   # should put turtle at the top of the circle
                t.pendown()     # sets turtle down and begins drawing 
                t.fillcolor("green")
                t.begin_fill()
            
                t.left(90)  # Point upwards
I changed the beginning of the code it should have moved the turtle all the way to the top. I have tried using t.setheading(90) as I seen mentioned in all the ways to try and fix this issue. 
When the t.setheading(90) was used, it messed up the eyes, mouth, and stem.

Having the previous code that wa given in the lab instructions is helpful as well. 
I add tried to fix the mouth and pumpkins before completing the rest of the lab, but I did not want to get stuck too long on one part of the lab.
Since the time was taken to define all of the different parts of the composite scence helped me to understand how the Interface design is important to writing codes, and what part is being effected.

When drawing the other three jack-o-lanterns, it was interesting to see that there would be three different sized ones. 
Also, that they all would carry the same deformed look. 

I was able to shift the mouth a bit to the left, but I can not figure out how to Get the mouth to sit straight in the middle.
I have redone this lab in total: 5 times at least. When I changed the the variables I used in the call function. It distorted everything.

I also had issue with moving the pumpkins to the bottom of the screen.
I still have a ways to go to be able to fully comprehend both to be able to troubleshoot these issues.
